            <h1>My name is Cody</h1>
            <p>I am a computer programming and cloud infrastructure major. I regularly engage in self-sabotage when it comes to classes, but <em>I am working on it</em>! My current goals are to once again establish an overall flow/schedule for my school and work life. I hope to use my training in school to get a career in a new field that will get me enough money that I can afford a new place to live. Coding is my secret joy, even if sometimes it feels a bit overwhelming. My current favorite thing to do alternates between gaming and reading. </p>
